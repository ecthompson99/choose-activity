This is a small script to improve the usage of the time dedicated to learn new things. I use it to keep a list of things to explore (concepts, tools, bricolage, etc.) and when needed can pick one of them and wait for a subsequent feedback.

Also it's a test to implement the technique in the paper "Mock roles, not objects".
