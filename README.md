# Choose your activity

This is a small tool I developed to improve the usage of my *learning time*.
My problem is to do many activities (read an article in German, try some framework, etc.), some are one-shot and some are recurring and done in small steps. Also, it's a way to try the TDD approach in the paper "*Mock roles, not objects*" in a small project.

I use it to mantain a list of things I want to do and choose one randomly, then give a feedback on the outcome. It helps me focus, because if when doing something I have more ideas I add them to the list instead of switching and risk not getting anything done.

I think it can be useful to others so here it is!

## How to use
There are no dependencies, just Python 3.7 or later. Run `python3 -m choose_activity` and follow the instructions.
